    {\bf VinSolutions, Software Engineering Intern, Contractor, Junior Developer} \>~~~~~~~~~~~~~May 2015 - Present\\
    Mission, KS 66202
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-10pt}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed .Net web application with a ReactJS front end to help automate manual deployments that were costing the company thousands of dollars per year in lost dev time.
		\item Expanded and maintained a developer portal, used by 18 dev teams, which managed the process of application deployments and provided a dashboard with a near real-time overview and history of deployments and app automation.
		\item Took initiative to build a service layer for the developer portal to replace the integration with Zapier which increased portal responsiveness and reduced costs paid to Zapier.
		\item Developed the companies first AWS based content management system for storing and serving terabytes of data off prem with my team to handle an ever increasing demand that would overwhelm the companies hardware. \vspace{-15pt}
